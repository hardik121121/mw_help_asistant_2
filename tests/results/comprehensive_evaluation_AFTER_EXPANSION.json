          "text": "### Introduction to WhatsApp Business API Integration\nTo set up WhatsApp Business API integration, create conversation flows, and implement message templates, we need to follow a series of steps that involve understanding API testing, handling API authentication, and potentially integrating with other services. However, the provided documentation does not directly address WhatsApp Business API integration. Instead, it offers insights into API testing, authentication, and integration with other platforms like Slack and ServiceNow.\n\n### Setting Up API Integration\nGiven the lack of direct information on WhatsApp Business API, we can infer that setting up any API integration involves several key steps:\n- **Importing APIs**: As mentioned in **Section 12: Importing APIs (Page 866)**, importing APIs into Watermelon can be done through various formats like OpenAPI Specification, Swagger, Postman Collection, HAR, or RR-Pair. This step is crucial for testing and integrating APIs.\n- **Handling API Authentication**: **Section 3: Handling API Authentication (Page 876)** explains the importance of handling API authentication. For WhatsApp Business API, this would involve obtaining the necessary authentication tokens or credentials.\n\n### Creating Conversation Flows\nCreating conversation flows might involve designing how your application interacts with users through WhatsApp. This could include:\n- **Defining User Journeys**: Similar to what's described in **Section 5: Configurations for Test Packs (Page 747)** for test packs, you would define the user journey or flow through your WhatsApp integration.\n- **Implementing Logic**: Using tools like the Logic Toolbox mentioned in **Section 10: Get Local Variable (Page 553)**, you can implement the logic for your conversation flows.\n\n### Implementing Message Templates\nImplementing message templates for WhatsApp Business API would require:\n- **Understanding Template Messages**: WhatsApp has specific guidelines for template messages that can be sent to users. This involves creating and approving message templates through the WhatsApp Business API or a business solution provider.\n- **Integration with Watermelon**: While the documentation does not directly cover WhatsApp, integrating approved message templates into your conversation flows within Watermelon would follow similar principles outlined for other integrations, such as Slack or ServiceNow.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the provided documentation does not directly address WhatsApp Business API integration, the principles of API testing, authentication, and integration can be applied. Setting up WhatsApp Business API integration involves obtaining the necessary credentials, importing or setting up the API within Watermelon, defining conversation flows, and implementing approved message templates. For detailed steps on WhatsApp Business API integration, referring to official WhatsApp or Meta for Developers documentation would be necessary, as the provided Watermelon documentation focuses on general API testing and integration principles.",

          "text": "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create custom attributes for contacts, use them in conversation flows, and set up personalized messaging:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n1. You have a Watermelon account with access to the Automation Functional Testing (AFT) workspace.\n2. You have basic knowledge of using the Watermelon platform, including navigating the interface and creating test cases.\n\n**Step 1: Create Custom Attributes for Contacts**\n1. Navigate to the **Repository View** in the Watermelon platform.\n2. Select **Create** to begin the process of creating custom attributes for contacts.\n3. Choose **Create New** to manually build a data set from scratch, defining columns and entering data inline, or **Import** to upload a pre-existing spreadsheet or CSV file.\n4. Assign a unique and descriptive **Test Data Set Name** (mandatory) and optionally provide a **Summary** to clarify the purpose and scope of the data.\n5. Add **Tags** to categorize and improve discoverability within the repository.\n6. Populate the **Data Grid** by clicking cells to enter or update values, adding new rows with the **Add Row** button, and columns as needed.\n\n**Step 2: Use Custom Attributes in Conversation Flows**\n1. Navigate to the **Recording Canvas** while creating or editing a snippet or test case.\n2. Click on the **Logic Toolbox** button in the left toolbox to access its blocks.\n3. Use the **Get Attribute** block to retrieve the value of a specific attribute from a web element, selecting the recorded web element and the attribute name.\n4. Use the **Set Attribute** block to update the value of a specific attribute of a web element, selecting the recorded web element, the name of the attribute to be updated, and the new value.\n5. Utilize the **Get Parameter** block to capture dynamic data that may be needed for assertions, further test steps, or validation purposes.\n\n**Step 3: Set Up Personalized Messaging Using Custom Attributes**\n1. Use the **Get Attribute** block to retrieve the custom attribute values for a contact.\n2. Use the **Set Parameter** block to set the value of the parameter at run time, which can be used to personalize messages.\n3. Utilize the **Enter Text** block to input editable content into text and password fields during test execution, which can be used to send personalized messages.\n4. Configure the conversation flow to use the custom attribute values to personalize messages, such as using the contact's name or preferences.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- Custom attributes are created and populated with data for contacts.\n- Custom attributes are used in conversation flows to retrieve and update attribute values.\n- Personalized messaging is set up using custom attributes to send targeted and relevant messages to contacts.\n\n**Relevant Screenshots:**\n- cache/images/page_0510_img_00.png (Get Attribute of Element block)\n- cache/images/page_0707_img_00.png (Get Attribute block)\n- cache/images/page_0393_img_00.png (Get Attribute block)\n\n**Tips and Warnings:**\n- Ensure that custom attributes are properly configured and populated with data to avoid errors in conversation flows.\n- Use the **Get Attribute** and **Set Attribute** blocks carefully to avoid overwriting or retrieving incorrect attribute values.\n- Test and validate conversation flows using custom attributes to ensure that personalized messaging is working as expected.",
